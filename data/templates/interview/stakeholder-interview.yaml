sections:
  - id: participant-background
    name: Background/Context
    extractEvidence: false
    outputFormat: paragraph
    prompt: |
      Summarize the stakeholder's background and context in two concise paragraphs that we can parse reliably.
      - Paragraph 1 must begin with "Stakeholder:" and describe role, department, responsibilities, and relationship to the initiative.
      - Paragraph 2 must begin with "Current Context:" and describe status quo, relevant history, past attempts, and situational factors.
      Keep each paragraph under 80 words and avoid bullet lists or headings beyond the specified openers.

  - id: research-questions
    name: Requirements
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    prompt: |
      Extract every requirement mentioned. Use a single dash "-" bullet per requirement with this exact structure:
      - Category: [Functional/Non-Functional/Business] | Priority: [Must-have/Should-have/Nice-to-have/Unstated] | Requirement: [concise description under 20 words]
      Include both explicit and implied requirements. Do not use numbered lists or additional headings.

  - id: key-findings
    name: Pain Points
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    dependencies:
      - research-questions
    prompt: |
      Identify every pain point or frustration. Use dash bullets with the following structure:
      - Pain Point: [problem] | Impact: [business effect] | Workaround: [current workaround or "None"] | Urgency: [High/Medium/Low or inferred]
      Keep each field brief so downstream parsers can split on the pipe character.

  - id: quotes
    name: "Goals & Success Criteria"
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    dependencies:
      - key-findings
    prompt: |
      Capture all goals and definitions of success. Use dash bullets with this structure:
      - Goal: [objective] | KPI: [metric or "Not specified"] | Success Definition: [how they measure completion] | Horizon: [Short-term/Long-term/Both]
      Include explicit statements first, then inferred goals.

  - id: analysis
    name: "Budget & Timeline"
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    dependencies:
      - key-findings
      - quotes
    prompt: |
      Capture all constraints using dash bullets with this structure:
      - Budget: [range or "Not discussed"] | Timeline: [date/frame] | Resources: [availability] | Flexibility: [Budget/TIme/Scope priority or "Rigid"]
      Mention any trade-offs directly in the field text; do not add extra bullets.

  - id: follow-up-items
    name: Follow-up Items
    extractEvidence: false
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    prompt: |
      List every follow-up or open question using dash bullets formatted as:
      - Type: [Question/Stakeholder/Data/Prototype/Decision] | Description: [specific ask] | Owner: [person/team or "Unassigned"] | Due: [date/timeframe or "TBD"]
      Only include actionable, concrete items.
