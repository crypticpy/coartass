description: "Organize raw MEF interview transcript into navigable sections with speaker labels, timestamps, and topic indexing - does NOT answer questionnaire questions"
icon: FileText
category: interview
outputs:
  - summary

sections:
  - id: participant-identification
    name: Participant Identification
    extractEvidence: false
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    prompt: |
      Identify all speakers in the transcript using dash bullets:
      - Speaker: [name if introduced] | Role: [interviewer/interviewee/notetaker/SME/other] | Identifier: [how they're referenced in transcript, e.g., "Speaker 1", "Dr. Martinez"]

      If speakers introduced themselves, capture their:
      - Full name and title (if stated)
      - Department or program area
      - Their relationship to the MEF being discussed

      Create a speaker key that can be used to label the structured transcript. Example:
      - S1 = Maria Chen, MEF Owner, Immunizations Program Manager
      - S2 = James Rodriguez, Interviewer, COOP Coordinator
      - S3 = Unknown speaker (IT questions)

      === SPECIAL CASES ===
      Multiple MEFs: If the interview covers more than one MEF, note:
      - MEF 1: [name] | Discussed at: [timestamp ranges]
      - MEF 2: [name] | Discussed at: [timestamp ranges]
      Flag this prominently: "WARNING: Multiple MEFs discussed - recommend separate analysis runs."

      Transcription Quality: Note any audio/transcription issues observed:
      - [timestamp]: Unclear audio - words may be incorrect
      - [timestamp]: Possible transcription error (e.g., "Works" vs "Worx")
      - [timestamp]: Speaker cut off or inaudible

  - id: section-boundaries
    name: Questionnaire Section Boundaries
    extractEvidence: false
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    dependencies:
      - participant-identification
    prompt: |
      Identify where in the transcript each MEF questionnaire section begins and ends.
      Use the standard MEF questionnaire structure:

      Map each section with timestamp ranges:
      - Section: Ownership & Contacts | Start: [timestamp or "0:00"] | End: [timestamp] | Coverage: [Complete/Partial/Not Covered]
      - Section: Criticality & Impact Assessment | Start: [timestamp] | End: [timestamp] | Coverage: [Complete/Partial/Not Covered]
      - Section: Legal/Regulatory Requirements | Start: [timestamp] | End: [timestamp] | Coverage: [Complete/Partial/Not Covered]
      - Section: Continuity Objectives | Start: [timestamp] | End: [timestamp] | Coverage: [Complete/Partial/Not Covered]
      - Section: Workarounds & Alternate Locations | Start: [timestamp] | End: [timestamp] | Coverage: [Complete/Partial/Not Covered]
      - Section: Technology & Data Requirements | Start: [timestamp] | End: [timestamp] | Coverage: [Complete/Partial/Not Covered]
      - Section: People & Roles | Start: [timestamp] | End: [timestamp] | Coverage: [Complete/Partial/Not Covered]
      - Section: Process Dependencies | Start: [timestamp] | End: [timestamp] | Coverage: [Complete/Partial/Not Covered]
      - Section: Performance & Equity | Start: [timestamp] | End: [timestamp] | Coverage: [Complete/Partial/Not Covered]

      Note: Some sections may be discussed out of order or revisited multiple times. Capture ALL occurrences.
      If a section was not covered, mark as "Not Covered" with no timestamps.

  - id: topic-index
    name: Topic Index
    extractEvidence: false
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    dependencies:
      - section-boundaries
    prompt: |
      Create a topic index of all significant discussion topics with timestamps.
      This helps interviewers and notetakers quickly find specific discussions.

      Format using dash bullets organized by topic:

      Systems & Applications Mentioned:
      - [System name]: Discussed at [timestamp(s)] | Context: [brief what was said about it]

      People & Roles Mentioned:
      - [Name/Role]: Discussed at [timestamp(s)] | Context: [why they were mentioned]

      Processes Described:
      - [Process name]: Discussed at [timestamp(s)] | Description: [brief summary]

      Concerns/Issues Raised:
      - [Issue]: Raised at [timestamp(s)] | By: [speaker] | Resolution: [if any]

      Follow-up Items:
      - [Item]: Mentioned at [timestamp(s)] | Owner: [if assigned] | Priority: [if stated]

      Include every named system, person, process, and concern. This is a reference index, not an analysis.

  - id: discussion-flow
    name: Discussion Flow Summary
    extractEvidence: false
    outputFormat: paragraph
    dependencies:
      - section-boundaries
      - topic-index
    prompt: |
      Provide a narrative summary of how the interview flowed, NOT the content.
      This helps orient someone reading the structured transcript.

      Write 3-4 paragraphs covering:

      Paragraph 1 - "Interview Opening:" Describe how the interview began, any introductions,
      and the initial framing of the MEF discussion.

      Paragraph 2 - "Flow of Discussion:" Describe the general path of the conversation.
      Did they follow the questionnaire order? Were there tangents? Did they revisit topics?
      Note any significant topic jumps or returns.

      Paragraph 3 - "Notable Dynamics:" Describe any notable interaction patterns -
      who spoke most, were there clarifying questions, did technical details prompt
      follow-up discussions, were there disagreements or corrections between participants?

      Paragraph 4 - "Closing:" How did the interview wrap up? Were next steps discussed?
      Were there outstanding questions deferred to later?

      Keep each paragraph under 60 words. Focus on STRUCTURE not content.

  - id: transcript-annotations
    name: Transcript Annotations
    extractEvidence: false
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    dependencies:
      - participant-identification
      - section-boundaries
      - topic-index
    prompt: |
      Create annotations that can be applied to the original transcript to make it navigable.
      Do NOT reproduce the full transcript - instead, provide a structured annotation guide.

      IMPORTANT: This is NOT analysis. You are creating reference markers, not summarizing.

      === SECTION MARKERS TO INSERT ===
      For each questionnaire section, provide the marker to insert:
      - Insert at [MM:SS]: "=== SECTION: Ownership & Contacts ==="
      - Insert at [MM:SS]: "=== SECTION: Technology & Data ==="
      [continue for all sections discussed]

      === SPEAKER KEY ===
      Provide consistent labels for the transcript:
      - "Speaker 1" or "[Unknown]" → [S1 - Maria Chen, MEF Owner]
      - "Speaker 2" → [S2 - James, Interviewer]
      [map all speakers]

      === TOPIC TRANSITION MARKERS ===
      - Insert at [MM:SS]: ">> Topic: Primary Systems <<"
      - Insert at [MM:SS]: ">> Topic: Backup Procedures <<"
      [list all topic transitions with timestamps]

      === CLARIFICATION FLAGS ===
      Mark unclear items for human review:
      - At [MM:SS]: Flag "[unclear: acronym NEDSS - expansion needed?]"
      - At [MM:SS]: Flag "[unclear: speaker interrupted, sentence incomplete]"
      - At [MM:SS]: Flag "[unclear: possible transcription error - 'Works' vs 'Worx'?]"
      [list all items needing clarification]

      === OUT-OF-ORDER DISCUSSIONS ===
      Note when topics were revisited or discussed out of questionnaire order:
      - Technology (Q21-26) discussed at [MM:SS] AND [MM:SS] - recommend consolidating
      - Criticality mentioned during technology discussion at [MM:SS] - cross-reference to Q5-8
      [list all out-of-order or revisited topics]

      === TANGENTS & INTERRUPTIONS ===
      Note significant tangents or interruptions:
      - At [MM:SS]-[MM:SS]: Off-topic discussion about [topic] - may contain useful context
      - At [MM:SS]: Interview interrupted, resumed at [MM:SS]
      [list any tangents or interruptions]

      Create a quick reference guide for navigating this structured transcript.

      Table of Contents:
      - Section 1: [name] | Page/Location: [marker] | Key Topics: [2-3 main topics]
      - Section 2: [name] | Page/Location: [marker] | Key Topics: [2-3 main topics]
      [continue for all sections]

      Speaker Quick Reference:
      - S1 = [Full identification]
      - S2 = [Full identification]
      [etc.]

      Key Systems Mentioned (alphabetical):
      - [System A]: See [timestamp/section]
      - [System B]: See [timestamp/section]
      [etc.]

      Gaps/Missing Coverage:
      - [Questionnaire section not covered or only partially covered]
      - [Topics that may need follow-up interview]

      This navigation guide should fit on one page and serve as a quick reference
      for the interviewer and notetaker when reconciling notes.
