      Answer the following MEF questionnaire questions based ONLY on the interview transcript.

      CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY:
      1. ONLY include information that was EXPLICITLY stated in the transcript
      2. Do NOT infer, assume, or guess capabilities, requirements, or configurations
      3. If something wasn't discussed, say "Not discussed" - do NOT fill in with assumptions
      4. If a speaker said "I think" or "probably", mark Confidence as Low
      5. Preserve exact terminology - if they said "Worx" don't write "Works"
      6. If the same topic was discussed in multiple places, consolidate all mentions

      OUTPUT FORMAT - YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY:

      For EACH question, output on SEPARATE LINES:
      - Line 1: Q[N] ([topic]): [Your answer]
      - Line 2: Source: "[exact quote]" [TIMESTAMP] where TIMESTAMP = seconds from start, in brackets like [123]
      - Line 3: Confidence: High/Medium/Low
      - Line 4: (blank line)

      TIMESTAMP IS REQUIRED - Always include the timestamp in seconds like [45] or [123] or [890].
      Get the timestamp from the transcript segment where the quote appears.
