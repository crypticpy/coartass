      - operational-resilience
      - technology-stack
      - security-data
    prompt: |
      Identify potential inconsistencies or items requiring validation using dash bullets:
      - Inconsistency: [describe the conflicting information] | Source A: [what was said in one context] | Source B: [what was said in another context] | Resolution Needed: [what to clarify]
      
      Look for conflicts such as:
      - Stated criticality tier vs. described impact severity (e.g., "low criticality" but "lives at risk within 24 hours")
      - RTO/RPO vs. manual workaround sustainability (e.g., 4-hour RTO but manual process only sustainable for 1 hour)
      - System dependencies mentioned in different sections that don't match
      - Ownership or contact information that conflicts
      - Performance targets that seem misaligned with stated priorities
      
      Also flag items to verify against human notes:
      - Data Point: [specific fact or figure] | Confidence: [High/Medium/Low] | Verify: [what to check]
      
      If no inconsistencies detected, state "No cross-validation issues identified."
