  - id: executive-summary
    name: Executive Summary
    extractEvidence: false
    outputFormat: paragraph
    prompt: |
      Write a 3-paragraph executive summary of this MEF interview.

      IMPORTANT: Only state facts that are EXPLICITLY mentioned in the transcript.
      Do NOT make inferences about system capabilities, requirements, or configurations
      unless the interviewee specifically stated them.

      Paragraph 1 - "MEF Overview:" Identify the Mission Essential Function, its criticality tier,
      the program/service area it supports, and the primary owner. State maximum tolerable
      downtime if discussed.

      Paragraph 2 - "Key Findings:" Summarize the 3-4 most significant findings from the interview.
      Focus on: continuity posture strengths, critical dependencies, and notable risks or gaps.
      Be specific - cite actual systems, timeframes, or processes mentioned.

      Paragraph 3 - "Recommended Actions:" List the 2-3 highest priority actions based on the
      interview. These should be concrete next steps that emerged from the discussion.

      Keep each paragraph under 80 words. Use precise language - avoid vague statements like
      "various systems" or "multiple dependencies."

      factual Q&A without memorable statements, note "Limited notable quotes -
      interview was primarily factual/procedural."

      - Be SPECIFIC (not "improve documentation" but "document the manual workaround process for [specific system]")
      - Link to a specific finding from the interview
      - Consider resource constraints mentioned

      If the interviewee mentioned specific improvement ideas or next steps,
      prioritize those over analyst-generated recommendations.

      === INCONSISTENCIES TO RESOLVE ===
      Any conflicting information from the interview:
      - Conflict: [description] | Resolution: [what to clarify]

      This section is critical for data completeness. Every "I don't know,"
      "we'd need to check," or skipped topic should be captured here.

  - id: notes-reconciliation
    name: Notes Reconciliation
    extractEvidence: false
    outputFormat: paragraph
    dependencies:
      - executive-summary
      - mef-profile

      - gaps-followups
    prompt: |
      If supplementary notetaker notes are provided, reconcile them with the transcript analysis.

      Write 2-3 paragraphs:

      Paragraph 1 - "Notes Summary:" Summarize key points from the notetaker's notes
      that add to or clarify the transcript. Highlight any details captured in notes
      that were unclear in the audio.

      Paragraph 2 - "Discrepancies:" Note any differences between the transcript analysis
      and the notetaker's notes. These may indicate:
      - Transcription errors (notetaker heard differently)
      - Context the notetaker captured that wasn't in audio
      - Different interpretations of the same statement

      Paragraph 3 - "Integrated Findings:" Provide any corrections or additions to
      the analysis based on the notes. Flag high-confidence corrections vs.
      items that need clarification with the interviewee.

      If no supplementary notes are available, write:
      "No supplementary notetaker notes were provided for this analysis.
      Consider requesting notes from the designated notetaker to verify
      technical details and capture any information not in the audio recording."
