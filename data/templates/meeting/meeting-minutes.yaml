sections:
  - id: attendees
    name: Attendees
    extractEvidence: false
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    prompt: |
      Extract all meeting attendees from the transcript. List each person who participated in the meeting, including their name and role if mentioned. Format as a bullet list with the following structure:
      - [Name] - [Role/Title] (if mentioned)

      If multiple speakers are identified, include them all. If roles are not explicitly stated, just list the names.

  - id: agenda-items
    name: Agenda Items
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    prompt: |
      Identify and list all agenda items or topics discussed during the meeting. Extract the main topics that were covered, presented, or brought up for discussion. Format as a numbered list with brief descriptions:
      1. [Topic Name]: [Brief one-sentence description]

      Focus on the planned or stated agenda items, as well as any emergent topics that received significant discussion time.

  - id: key-discussions
    name: Key Discussions
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: paragraph
    dependencies:
      - agenda-items
    prompt: |
      Summarize the key discussions and deliberations from the meeting. For each major topic, provide:
      - The main points raised
      - Different perspectives or opinions expressed
      - Important context or background information shared
      - Questions asked and answers provided

      Structure this as paragraphs organized by topic. Focus on substance over procedural matters. Include who said what when it adds important context.

  - id: decisions-made
    name: Decisions Made
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    dependencies:
      - agenda-items
      - key-discussions
    prompt: |
      Extract the most important decisions, resolutions, or conclusions reached during the meeting. Focus on high-impact choices or policy changes rather than minor acknowledgements. For each decision, specify:
      - What was decided
      - Who made or approved the decision (if mentioned)
      - Any conditions, caveats, or timeline associated with the decision
      - The reasoning or justification provided (if any)

      Output no more than 6 decisions for meetings under 45 minutes and no more than 10 for longer sessions unless the transcript clearly documents a larger number of discrete decisions. If many trivial acknowledgements occur, summarize them in one bullet rather than listing each individually. Format as a bullet list and ignore vague commitments like "we should look into" unless a concrete decision was made.

  - id: action-items
    name: Action Items
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    dependencies:
      - decisions-made
      - agenda-items

      - The specific task or action to be taken
      - Who is responsible (assignee)
      - Deadline or timeframe (if mentioned)
      - Any dependencies or prerequisites

      Format as a checklist with clear ownership:
      - [ ] [Task description] - Assigned to: [Person] - Due: [Date/Timeframe]

      Only include concrete, actionable tasks with clear owners when possible. If no owner is specified, note "Unassigned".

  - id: next-steps
    name: Next Steps
    extractEvidence: false
    outputFormat: paragraph
    dependencies:
      - action-items
    prompt: |

      - Upcoming meetings or follow-up sessions planned
      - Topics to be revisited or continued in future discussions
      - Information that needs to be gathered before next meeting
      - Any parking lot items or deferred topics

      Write as a concise paragraph focusing on forward-looking commitments and continuity.
