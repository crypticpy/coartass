      Write a concise 4-6 sentence summary of what happened based on the radio traffic.

      - Incident type and location
      - First-arriving unit and initial conditions (fire/smoke, structure type)
      - Strategy declared (offensive/defensive)
      - Major milestones reached (command, 360, knockdown, searches)
      - Overall communication quality assessment (clear/unclear, disciplined/chaotic)

      Example format:
      "Box alarm at [address] on TAC [channel] for [incident type]. [First unit] arrived to find [conditions] and declared [strategy]. Operations included [key actions]. Communications were [quality assessment] with [notable strength or issue]."

      Produce a quick compliance checklist using this format:
      - [✓ Met / ✗ Missed / — Not Observed] <item> — Evidence: "<short quote>" [timestamp]

      Checklist items to evaluate:

      **Arrival & Size-Up:**
      - Arrival/on scene announced
      - Structure description given
      - Fire/smoke conditions reported

      **Command & Strategy:**
      - Command assumed
      - Strategy/mode declared (offensive/defensive)
      - 360 reported (attempted/complete/not complete)

      **Operations:**
      - CAN report(s) present (Conditions/Actions/Needs)
      - Primary search complete announced
      - Knockdown announced
      - Under control announced

      **Safety:**
      - RIC established (if applicable)
      - Safety officer assigned (if applicable)

      Rules:
      - Use "✓ Met" only for explicit radio announcements
      - Use "✗ Missed" if the benchmark should have been announced but wasn't
      - Use "— Not Observed" if not stated (may not be applicable)
      - Always include a short quote and timestamp for Met items

    name: Coaching Points
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    prompt: |
      Provide 5 specific coaching points for classroom discussion.

      Format each as an actionable statement:
      - **[Topic]**: <What to do next time>. Example from audio: "<quote>" [timestamp]

      Focus on:

      1. **Size-up clarity** - Was the initial picture clear for incoming units?
      2. **Command presence** - Was command clearly established and coordinated?
      3. **CAN discipline** - Did interior crews provide useful CAN updates?
      4. **Benchmark announcements** - Were key milestones transmitted?
      5. **Radio discipline** - Clear unit IDs, concise messages, no stepped-on traffic?

      Rules:
      - Phrase as coaching ("Next time, consider...") not criticism
      - Reference specific examples from the audio
      - Balance positive reinforcement with improvement areas
      - Keep each point to 1-2 sentences
