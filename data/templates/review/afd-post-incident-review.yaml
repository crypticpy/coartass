name: AFD Post-Incident Review (Narrative)
description: Structured post-incident narrative aligned to AFD training review practices (incident overview, benchmarks, compliance, improvements, recommendations). Produces evidence-linked sections with timestamps.

outputs:
  - summary

  - decisions
  - quotes

sections:
  - id: incident-overview
    name: Incident Overview
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: paragraph
    prompt: |
      Write a concise incident overview in 6–10 sentences based ONLY on what is stated in the radio traffic.
      Include (if present):
      - Incident type (structure fire, MVC, rescue, etc.)
      - Primary TAC / channel references
      - First-arriving unit actions and initial conditions (Alpha/Bravo, smoke/fire location)
      - Strategy/mode of operation (offensive/defensive/investigation)

      Rules:
      - Do not speculate. If unknown, state "Not stated in radio traffic."
      - Use plain language suitable for training documentation.

  - id: key-actions-and-timeline
    name: Key Actions & Timeline
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    prompt: |
      Extract a time-ordered list of key operational events as dash bullets.
      Each bullet MUST follow this format:
      - [timestamp] Event: <short label> | Unit(s): <if known> | Notes: <1 sentence>

      Focus on events that are commonly benchmarked or trained:
      - arrival/on scene, command established, 360, mode/strategy declared
      - water on fire, knockdown, under control, extinguished
      - primary/secondary search complete, RIC established, safety officer assigned
      - utilities shutoff, rehab, mayday (if any)

      If timestamps are missing for an event, omit it rather than guessing.

  - id: benchmark-observations
    name: Benchmark Observations (Transcript-Only)
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: table
    prompt: |
      Create a table with columns:
      - Benchmark (label)
      - Observed? (Yes/No)
      - Evidence (short quote + [timestamp])
      - Notes (1 sentence)

      Include these benchmark labels (even if not observed):
      - Command established
      - First water on fire
      - Primary search complete
      - Secondary search complete
      - Fire knocked down
      - Fire under control
      - Fire extinguished
      - Water supply established
      - Utilities shutoff

      Rules:
      - Mark "Observed? = No" if not explicitly stated in the transcript.
      - Do not infer from context; rely on explicit radio statements.

  - id: a1016-compliance-observations
    name: A101.6 Compliance Observations (Transcript-Only)
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: table
    prompt: |
      Create a table with columns:
      - Policy Element (label)
      - Observed? (Yes/No/Partial)
      - Evidence (short quote + [timestamp])
      - Notes (1 sentence)

      Evaluate these elements ONLY using the radio traffic:
      - Initial size-up includes structure/conditions
      - Strategy/mode declared
      - 360 attempted/complete/not complete reported
      - Command transfer (if any) is structured
      - CAN reports used (conditions/actions/needs)
      - Divisions/groups announced (if any)
      - RIC established (if any)
      - Safety officer assigned (if any)

      Rules:
      - If an element is not present, mark Observed? = No.
      - If partially present (e.g., conditions but no structure details), mark Partial.

  - id: strengths-and-improvements
    name: Strengths & Areas for Improvement
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    prompt: |
      Provide two subsections using dash bullets:

      Strengths:
      - <bullet>
      - <bullet>

      Areas for Improvement:
      - <bullet>
      - <bullet>

      Rules:
      - Keep each bullet to one sentence.
      - Tie claims to what was said on the radio (no speculation).

  - id: training-recommendations
    name: Training Recommendations
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    prompt: |
      Provide 5–10 actionable training recommendations as dash bullets.
      Each bullet must follow:
      - Recommendation: <action> | Why: <brief> | Suggested drill: <brief>

      Rules:
      - Base recommendations only on observed communications and gaps.
      - Do not recommend policy changes unless the transcript clearly indicates a recurring protocol miss.
