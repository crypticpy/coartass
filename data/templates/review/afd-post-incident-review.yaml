sections:
  - id: incident-overview
    name: Incident Overview
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: paragraph
    prompt: |
      Write a comprehensive incident overview based on ALL radio traffic in this transcript from START to FINISH.

      CRITICAL: You MUST cover the ENTIRE incident timeline, including:
      - Early phase (0-10 min): Dispatch, arrival, initial operations
      - Middle phase (10-30 min): Active firefighting, searches, water supply
      - Late phase (30+ min): Overhaul, utilities, incident stabilization, demobilization

      Include these elements when present:
      - Dispatch information: incident type, location address, TAC channel
      - First-arriving unit and initial size-up (structure description, fire/smoke conditions)
      - Strategy/mode declared (offensive/defensive/investigation)
      - Key operational milestones (360 complete, divisions assigned, RIC, knockdown, searches)
      - Notable challenges or changes during operations
      - Final disposition (under control, extinguished, units released)
      - Total incident duration if announced

      Radio Traffic Format Notes:
      - Unit identifiers follow patterns like "Engine 25", "Rescue 28", "Battalion 2"
      - Timestamps are in [MM:SS] format at the start of each segment
      - Size-up uses Alpha/Bravo/Charlie/Delta side designations

      Rules:
      - Extract ALL information from the ENTIRE transcript - do not stop at 20 minutes
      - Cite specific timestamps in [seconds] format for key events
      - If information conflicts (e.g., "single-story" vs "two-story"), note the discrepancy
      - Write in past tense for completed actions
      - Aim for 10-15 sentences to capture the full incident

    outputFormat: bullet_points
    dependencies:
      - incident-overview
    prompt: |
      Create a comprehensive chronological timeline of ALL significant events from the ENTIRE radio traffic.

      CRITICAL: Cover the FULL incident from dispatch to demobilization. Do NOT stop at 20 minutes.

      Format each entry EXACTLY as:
      - **[MM:SS] Event label** | Unit(s): unit IDs | Notes: 1 sentence

      Example:
      - **[3:27] Command established** | Unit(s): Engine 25 | Notes: Single-story, fire Alpha/Bravo

      REQUIRED events to include (when present in transcript):
      - Dispatch/Alarm
      - First unit arrival/on scene
      - Command established (with unit ID)
      - Initial size-up transmitted
      - Strategy/mode declared (offensive/defensive)
      - 360 completion reported
      - Division/group assignments
      - RIC established
      - Water supply status (assigned, established, low water alerts)
      - Interior entry and conditions reports
      - Primary search initiated and completed
      - Secondary search assigned/completed
      - Fire knockdown
      - Fire under control
      - Fire extinguished
      - Utilities shutoff (power, gas)
      - Safety officer assigned
      - Significant tactical changes or challenges
      - PAR checks
      - Any mayday or emergency traffic
      - Units released/available
      - Total incident time announced

      Rules:
      - Include events from the ENTIRE transcript, not just the first 20 minutes
      - Use exact [MM:SS] timestamps from the transcript
      - Capture unit IDs exactly as stated (Engine 25, not E25)
      - Aim for 15-25 timeline entries for a typical incident

  - id: benchmark-observations
    name: Benchmark Observations (Transcript-Only)
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: table
    dependencies:
      - key-actions-and-timeline
    prompt: |
      Create a benchmark observation table evaluating key incident milestones.

      OUTPUT FORMAT - Use proper markdown table syntax:

      | Benchmark | Observed? | Timestamp | Evidence Quote | Notes |
      |-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------|
      | Command established | Yes | 3:27 | "Engine 25 assuming command" | First command |
      | Primary search complete | No | - | - | Not announced |

      REQUIRED benchmarks to evaluate (one row per benchmark):
      1. Command established - First unit assumes command
      2. First water on fire - "Water on the fire" or equivalent announced
      3. Primary search complete - "Primary search complete" with findings
      4. Secondary search complete - "Secondary complete" announcement
      5. Fire knocked down - "Knocked down" or "bulk of fire knocked"
      6. Fire under control - "Under control" announced
      7. Fire extinguished - "Extinguished" announced
      8. Water supply established - Hydrant/supply confirmed operational
      9. Utilities shutoff - Power/gas shutoff confirmed
      10. RIC established - RIC team assigned and confirmed
      11. Safety officer assigned - Safety role announced

      Scoring rules:
      - "Yes" = Explicitly stated in radio traffic with clear announcement
      - "No" = Not stated in the transcript (benchmark was not transmitted)
      - Include verbatim quote and MM:SS timestamp for all "Yes" entries
      - For "No" entries, use "-" for Timestamp and Evidence Quote columns

      IMPORTANT: Do NOT mark something as "Yes" based on inference - only explicit radio announcements count.

    name: A101.6 Compliance Observations (Transcript-Only)
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: table
    dependencies:
      - incident-overview
      - key-actions-and-timeline
    prompt: |
      Evaluate compliance with AFD A101.6 radio communication standards.

      OUTPUT FORMAT - Use proper markdown table syntax:

      | Policy Element | Observed? | Evidence Quote | Timestamp | Notes |
      |----------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------|
      | Initial size-up | Yes | "two-story structure, heavy fire Bravo side" | 4:25 | Complete |
      | Strategy declaration | Partial | "offensive mode" | 5:10 | No mode changes announced |

      REQUIRED policy elements to evaluate (one row per element):

      1. **Initial size-up completeness** - Structure type/height, fire/smoke conditions, exposures
      2. **Strategy/mode declaration** - Offensive/defensive/investigation stated, mode changes announced
      3. **360 degree survey** - 360 completion announced, conditions on all sides
      4. **Command establishment and transfer** - Command assumed clearly, transfer briefing if applicable
      5. **CAN reports** - Interior crews provide Conditions/Actions/Needs updates
      6. **Division/Group structure** - Divisions assigned and announced with assignments
      7. **RIC establishment** - RIC assigned with unit ID and acknowledgment
      8. **Safety officer** - Safety role assigned and acknowledged

      Scoring:
      - "Yes" = Element clearly present and properly executed
      - "Partial" = Element present but incomplete (note what's missing in Notes column)
      - "No" = Not present in transcript
      - "N/A" = Not applicable to this incident type

      Use "-" for empty cells. Include MM:SS timestamps.

  - id: strengths-and-improvements
    name: Strengths & Areas for Improvement
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    dependencies:
      - benchmark-observations
      - a1016-compliance-observations
    prompt: |
      Based on the benchmark and compliance observations, provide specific feedback.

      FORMAT - Use these exact markdown headers and bullet format:

      ## Strengths

      - **Clear initial size-up** | Source: "two-story structure, heavy fire..." [4:25]
      - **Timely command establishment** | Source: "Engine 25 assuming command" [3:27]

      ## Areas for Improvement

      - **Missing secondary search announcement** | Source: Not stated in radio traffic
      - **Incomplete command transfer briefing** | Source: "assuming command" [4:20] - no status given

      REQUIRED: List 4-6 items in each section.

      Look for these STRENGTHS:
      - Clear initial size-up with actionable information
      - Timely strategy declaration
      - Effective CAN reporting from interior
      - Proper benchmark announcements
      - Clear command presence and coordination
      - Good division/group management

      Look for these IMPROVEMENT AREAS:
      - Missing or delayed benchmark announcements
      - Incomplete CAN reports (missing needs, conditions, or actions)
      - Unclear or conflicting information
      - Radio discipline issues (unclear unit IDs, stepping on traffic)
      - Missing safety-critical communications

      Rules:
      - Be specific - cite exact quotes and [MM:SS] timestamps
      - Focus on actionable communication improvements
      - Balance positive reinforcement with constructive feedback
      - Use bold for the issue/strength label

  - id: training-recommendations
    name: Training Recommendations
    extractEvidence: true
    outputFormat: bullet_points
    dependencies:
      - strengths-and-improvements
    prompt: |
      Provide 5-8 specific training recommendations based on the observations.

      FORMAT - Use this exact structure for each recommendation:

      ### 1. Practice command-transfer brief with CAN update
      - **Why**: Assumption lacked status/benchmarks
      - **Evidence**: "assuming command" [4:20]
      - **Suggested Drill**: Role-play transfer with conditions/actions/needs in 15 seconds

      ### 2. Drill water-supply forecasting
      - **Why**: Interior held due to near-empty tank
      - **Evidence**: "almost out of water" [11:02]
      - **Suggested Drill**: Hydrant-to-attack transition with timed radio updates

      Focus areas for fireground radio training:

      1. **Size-up and Arrival Reports** - Structure description, conditions, strategy timing
      2. **Benchmark Communications** - Command, 360, searches, knockdown, under control
      3. **CAN Report Discipline** - Complete format, trigger points, interior reporting
      4. **Division/Group Operations** - Assignment clarity, talk-paths, accountability
      5. **Support Functions** - Water supply, utilities, RIC, safety comms
      6. **Radio Discipline** - Unit ID, brevity, avoiding stepped-on traffic

      Rules:
      - Tie each recommendation to specific observed issues from this incident
      - Provide practical, specific drill suggestions
      - Prioritize safety-critical communications first
      - Use numbered headers (### 1., ### 2., etc.) for each recommendation
